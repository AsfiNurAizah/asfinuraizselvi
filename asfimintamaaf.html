                                    <p>My best friend Selvi Rizki Agustin,</p>
                                    <p>This is from Asfi. Maybe I'm the person you hate the most. I hope you are always healthy. It's been about a month since we lost contact, and I feel like I've lost enough. I realize all my mistakes. I'm lucky to have met a friend like you. I already think of you as more than a friend, but like my own sister.</p>
                                    <p>As long as we lost contact, I really kept thinking. Everyone said I was selfish, everyone also said I was wrong. In the 3 years we've known each other, I've only ever felt like I've really made a good friend, an understanding friend who always gives everything. Here I really regret it. I want us to make things right again. I know this is difficult for you, after yesterday we fought, we had a lot of misunderstandings. We will rearrange our friendship. I love you sister and I miss you.</p>
                                    <p>I want us to be together again, support each other again, regardless of what I have done, disappointed you, made you angry, made you hate me. I'm really sorry. I want to grow together, learn together with you in this life.</p>
                                    <p>There are still many stories that we have imagined together, we still have a lot of plans for the future. We are already planning that when we graduate we will go abroad together. Mother, I like to ask why you never play at my place anymore. I can't be honest with mother if we have problems again. After this I promise I will be better, I can control my own emotions better, I will introspect myself. I am really sorry for everything that has happened, I am truly sorry. I will always be open to you whenever you want to contact me. I love you best female friend.</p>
                                    <p>I don't think it's enough for me to explain everything in this article to you. Once again I apologize and I regret what I have done.</p>
                                    <p>We learn together, grow together, develop together. Do you want to be friends with me again?</p>
                                    <p>Give me another chance to be a good friend ðŸ˜Š</p>
                                    <p>Please give me access to contact you, via any social media, unblock it. I really miss our time together.</p>
